## Installation

1. Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed. I've tested it on
   version 14.17.4. Then `cd` into the project directory and run `npm install`.
2. You also need the Unix utility `sox`.

<!-- 2. Install Liquidsoap. On Ubuntu systems, you can do this:
   `sudo apt install liquidsoap`. On other systems,
   [see the Liquidsoap documentation][liq-install]. -->
